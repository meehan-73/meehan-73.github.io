              Thank you for visiting! On this site, I plan to paint a picture of who I am as an academic, a professional, 
              and most importantly, a person. Currently, I am seeking employment as a data scientist, but I believe my
              background in mathematics, and problem solving in general, could extend to a variety of disciplines. As a
              result, I hope that this page gives you a sense of my main areas of interest. If not for anything else, the
              process of designing this webpage gave me some fun experience with HTML, CSS, and git.

              I figure I should give some insight as to my current background and what I'm trying to do. In what follows, you'll
              see the route I took to become the person I am today.

            <h3>Lifelong Love of Mathematics</h3>
            <p class="text">
              I have always had a love of mathematics. My parents tell me that as a two-year old, I would often place myself directly 
              in front of the TV at night; the NJ Lottery was on, and I absolutely loved watching all of the numbers flop around. Over 
              the years, math has become more than just a subject to me â€” it is my profession, my passion. Very early on (at two years old,
              apparently), I decided I wanted to learn as much math as I possibly could. In high school, this amounted to taking both AP 
              Calculus AB/BC exams, as well as AP Statistics, but things got more interesting once I got to college.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              In college at The University of Notre Dame, I decided to be one of 10-15 students to major in "Honors" Mathematics; Honors Mathematics 
              was a specialized program where students would receive experience in theoretical (think "proof-based") math classes. Not only was 
              arriving at the right answer important, but also the process at which the right answer was found. This turned math upside down for me - 
              it was suddenly a game, a game with which logic was at the forefront and argumentation was key. After all, what's the purpose of a right 
              answer if you can't convincingly defend it? In 2013, I graduated undergrad with a Bachelors of Science in Mathematics, with a thesis on 
              the combinatorial topic of Ramsey Theory. I figured, "Why quit a good thing?", and so onward I went to graduate school at The Ohio State
              University.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              The idea of picking an area of math to focus on for my PhD was more intimidating than I could have ever imagined. "Lions, and tigers, and 
              bears, oh my?"... more like, "Abstract Algebra, and Geometry, Topology, and Differential Equations, and 20+ other areas, oh my!" With my
              previous experience in Combinatorics, coupled with the idea that I wanted to go into industry after graduation, I settled on Random Matrix
              Theory - an area that lies within the intersection of Probability, Statistics, and Combinatorics. My advisor, Dr. Hoi Nguyen, was at the 
              forefront of the field and provided insight that was truly invaluable throughout the entire process. In laymen's terms, my focus was on some
              universality problems; I enjoyed looking at problems where results were known in specific settings, and extending them to more compicated
              settings. This would mean the result was universal. I think this is a valuable way of looking at things, and it - universality - appears in 
              life more often than you'd expect. What culminated was a doctorate in mathematics and an appreciation for the immense amount of dedication
              that the PhD process entailed.

            <h3>Enter Data Science</h3>
            <p class="text">
              Toward the end of my graduate education, I decided I wanted to take up programming to supplement what I was seeing in school. After all,
              what better reality check is there for dealing with random matrices than actually writing out some code to generate the distributions and
              check how the eigenvectors are behaving? This started my road to data science. I quickly began to realize just how much I enjoy coding, 
              and soon after I turned to modeling and analyzing datasets. I have, elsewhere on this page, a list of the many courses I've taken online to 
              instill a solid foundation in data science. There is always more to learn, and I'm excited to learn it!
